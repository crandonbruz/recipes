# Recipes

Here is a recipe locator application.

I made the frontend using next.js. The backend is using express. My further implementations are to implement a registration so users can save their recipies they have made. I will also be updating the api to one that shows images of the recipes the user searches.

## Steps to use:

For.env steps feel free to contact me.

1. Clone the repo
2. Run both scripts on package.json
